### Running Akka Stream with Actors

{% include nav.html %}
[Supervise](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/fault-tolerance.html#default-supervisor-strategy){:target="_blank"}, and integrate Akka [Actors](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html){:target="_blank"} with Akka Streams.

Streams need something to handle failures, and they should be able to receive and send Actor messages.

[CallStream](https://github.com/garyaiki/dendrites/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/github/garyaiki/dendrites/stream/actor/CallStream.scala){:target="_blank"} is a generic Actor for running streams. It's created with a [RunnableGraph](http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/current/akka/stream/scaladsl/RunnableGraph.html){:target="_blank"}. [SourceQueue](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/stream/stages-overview.html#queue){:target="_blank"} must be the Source of the RunnableGraph to take messages received by the Actor. An Actor message of the right type is offered to SourceQueue in CallStream's `receive` method. An OfferResult Future is piped back to CallStream's `offerResultHandler` it logs a warning if the message was dropped or throws an exception if the queue can't accept it. Accepted messages are processed by the stream. Thrown exceptions are handled by Actor Supervisors.

[CallStreamSupervisor](https://github.com/garyaiki/dendrites/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/github/garyaiki/dendrites/stream/actor/CallStreamSupervisor.scala){:target="_blank"} is a generic actor supervisor that creates CallStream with a RunnableGraph and handles its errors. If CallStreamâ€™s offerResultHandler throws an exception CallStreamSupervisor has a decider that will either Restart CallStream, Stop it, or Escalate the exception. Messages received by CallStreamSupervisor are forwarded to CallStream. Actors sending messages directly to CallStream should put a DeathWatch on it.

CallStream and CallStreamSupervisor are provided for convenience, users are free to combine actors and streams in other ways.

##### Actor Ref used as a stream's sink
An Actor Supervisor can create both an actor running a stream and another actor used as its Sink.

[Sink.actorRef](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/stream/stages-overview.html#actorref){:target="_blank"} forwards the message pushed from the last flow to another actor. The supervisor creates the sink actor then the stream actor with the sink actorRef. [DeathWatch](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#lifecycle-monitoring-aka-deathwatch){:target="_blank"} is put on the sink actor, when it dies, the stream actor is restarted with a new actorRef.
