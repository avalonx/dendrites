An Actor [Supervisor](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/fault-tolerance.html) creates both an actor running a stream and an actor used as its Sink.

[Sink.actorRef](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/stream/stages-overview.html#actorRef) forwards the message pushed from the last flow to another actor. The supervisor creates the sink actor then the stream actor with the sink actorRef. [DeathWatch](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.11/scala/actors.html#Lifecycle_Monitoring_aka_DeathWatch) is put on the sink actor, when it dies, the stream actor is restarted with a new actorRef.
