[CallStream](https://github.com/garyaiki/dendrites/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/gs/stream/actor/CallStream.scala) is a generic Actor that runs streams.

[SourceQueue](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/stream/stages-overview.html#queue) is offered messages received by the actor one at a time, the queue immediately returns a Future OfferResult that is piped back to the actor. `offerResultHandler` does nothing if the message was accepted and pushed downstream, logs a warning if the message was dropped, throws an exception if the queue is closed, failures are logged and there exceptions thrown.

CallStream is constructed with a runnable graph with any flows and any sink.

CallStreamSupervisor is a generic supervisor that creates CallStream with a RunnableGraph and handles its errors. An error in the stream invokes a Supervision Decider when an error causes the stream to stop, the actorâ€™s offerResultHandler throws an exception to the supervisor.

CallStreamSupervisor receives messages intended for CallStream and forwards them. This saves actors sending to CallStream from putting a DeathWatch on it.
